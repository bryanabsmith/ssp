systemd (Linux)

To start ssp at boot on a Linux system with systemd, do the following:

1. Open up systemd/ssp.sh and edit it if need be with appropriate directories.
2. Copy systemd/ssp.sh somewhere.
3. Open up systemd/ssp.service and edit ExecStart if need be (as per where you put systemd/ssp.sh on your machine).
4. Make ssp.sh executable (chmod +x <location of ssp.sh).
5. Test everything by executing the following:
  a. systemctl daemon-reload
  b. systemctl start ssp
  c. systemctl status ssp
6. If 5(c) reports back that everything is good (Active: active (running) in green), enable ssp to run at boot: systemctl enable ssp.


rc.d (FreeBSD)

To start ssp at boot on a FreeBSD system, do the following:

1. Copy freebsd/ssp to /etc/rc.d/
2. Edit /etc/rc.d/ssp to accommodate your configuration.
3. Add ssp_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf.

NOTE: This (3) will block the boot process. I don't know enough about FreeBSD at this point to fix this.
