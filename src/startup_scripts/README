systemd (Linux)

To start theatre at boot on a Linux system with systemd, do the following:

1. Open up systemd/theatre.sh and edit it if need be with appropriate directories.
2. Copy systemd/theatre.sh somewhere.
3. Open up systemd/theatre.service and edit ExecStart if need be (as per where you put systemd/theatre.sh on your machine).
4. Make theatre.sh executable (chmod +x <location of theatre.sh).
5. Test everything by executing the following:
  a. systemctl daemon-reload
  b. systemctl start theatre
  c. systemctl status theatre
6. If 5(c) reports back that everything is good (Active: active (running) in green), enable theatre to run at boot: systemctl enable theatre.


rc.d (FreeBSD)

To start theatre at boot on a FreeBSD system, do the following:

1. Copy freebsd/theatre to /etc/rc.d/
2. Edit /etc/rc.d/theatre to accommodate your configuration.
3. Add theatre_enable="YES" to /etc/rc.conf.

NOTE: This (3) will block the boot process. I don't know enough about FreeBSD at this point to fix this.


Windows

To start theatre at boot on a FreeBSD system, do the following:

1. Copy start_theatre.bat to "C:\Users\{<your username>}\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup\" (replace {your_username} with your username).
2. Edit start_theatre.bat as necessary, changing (if need be) the directory to start_theatre.ps1.

This is not the most elegant solution but it works for now.
