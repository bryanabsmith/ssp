# This controls how theatre reports the IP that pages are served from. There are two options, True or False. If set to True (or anything but False), your local host's IP address is returned. If this is False, a fully qualified domain name is returned. If you're unsure as to what you should use, try setting this to True and if you don't see your local IP, set it to False. On some platforms with different host configurations, this may require some trial and error.
usehostname=True

# FreeBSD throws an error when getting the IP unless a workaround (netifaces) is used and Linux sometimes doesn't report back the proper interface. Setting this to True makes use of an alternative method to get your local IP.
# NOTE: Using netifaces requires that you have it installed. Execute "pip install netifaces" or use your Linux distribution's or FreeBSD's native netifaces packages (ports: /net/py27-netifaces) if you're running the Python version.
# NOTE 2: While OS X also qualifies as *nix, this workaround isn't needed but can be used.

# This serves two purposes. First, it serves as the interface for use_nix_ip_workaround. Second, it serves as the reference for the server status info about network traffic.

# Set this to True to have your external IP reported back at startup.
# NOTE: MyExternalIP limits requests to 30/minute so don't restart the server with this set to True more than 30 times per minute (would you even be doing that anyway?).

[auth]
# Do you want to password protect your web server with basic auth?
