# This controls how ssp reports the IP that pages are served from. There are two options, True or False. If set to True (or anything but False), your local host's IP address is returned. If this is False, a fully qualified domain name is returned. If you're unsure as to what you should use, try setting this to True and if you don't see your local IP, set it to False. On some platforms with different host configurations, this may require some trial and error.

# So, Linux poses some issues with getting an IP address. Set this to true if ssp reports back the localhost IP to use a different method.
