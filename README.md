Simple web server for the "Summer Server Project."

Note - this is not meant to, in its current state, be used in anything other than a local testing environment. This is an application being developed as a learning exercise.

## What is this?
This is part of a learning project whose goal is to explore how to write a server and, in so doing, learn about networking.

This project is not designed to be used in any sort of production environment. As a learning project, there's a lot about serving content that I don't know and, thus, I'm sure this server is riddled with security holes/weaknesses. Consequently, I take no responsibility for any issues that may arise and, indeed, this should be used as little more than code to learn (or not) from. That said, I do intend for this to work so, in this sense, it should do what it is designed to do - serve web content.

## Progress

### Milestone 1:
* Intended release date: June 15th
* Goal: to have a functioning (however limited) server that forms the foundation for further work. At this point, the code should serve content, be configurable and log requests. None of this is particularly hard with Python but I think it's important to have a goal for an initial milestone release.

### Future Milestones: TBD.
